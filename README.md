### 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in statistical modeling and a track record of driving business impact. With a background in **Supply Chain Management** (where I drove **$3.7M+ in optimizations**), I bridge the gap between complex algorithms and strategic ROI.

My technical approach is grounded in **first principles**. I specialize in:
* **ML & Math:** Implementing algorithms like **Hidden Markov Models** and **Clustering** from scratch to deeply understand their mechanics, while applying **CNNs** and Deep Learning frameworks for complex pattern recognition.
* **Modern Data Engineering:** Architecting scalable pipelines using **DuckDB, dbt,** and **SQL** to transform unstructured data into investment-ready insights.
* **Multimodal Analysis:** Fusing behavioral data, audio transcripts, and vision/eye-tracking metrics to solve high-stakes problems in healthcare and education.

- 🔭 **M.S. Thesis:** Engineered a multimodal pipeline for **ADHD Diagnosis** integrating eye-tracking (NiCATS) and behavioral data (IVA2), using graph-based feature engineering (AOI entropy) to define high-risk computational phenotypes.
- 🔬 **Research Interests:** Human-Centered AI (HCAI), Explainable AI (XAI), AI in Education, Affective Computing, and Multimodal User Modeling.
- 🌱 **Learning:** Currently mastering **Generative AI** and **LLM Fine-tuning**.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Python, Probability, SQL, and Data Strategy.
