# Hi there, I'm Rushmila! 👋

🚀 Data Scientist (M.S. CS) | AI Researcher | Strategy & Operations

👩‍💻 About Me

I am a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling and a track record of driving business impact. With a background in Supply Chain Management (where I drove $3.7M+ in optimizations), I bridge the gap between complex algorithms and strategic ROI.

My technical approach is grounded in first principles. I specialize in:

ML & Math: Implementing algorithms like Hidden Markov Models and Clustering from scratch to deeply understand their mechanics, while applying CNNs and Deep Learning frameworks for complex pattern recognition.

Modern Data Engineering: Architecting scalable pipelines using DuckDB, dbt, and SQL to transform unstructured data into investment-ready insights.

Multimodal Analysis: Fusing behavioral data, audio transcripts, and vision/eye-tracking metrics to solve high-stakes problems in healthcare and education.

🔭 M.S. Thesis: Engineered a multimodal pipeline for ADHD Diagnosis integrating eye-tracking (NiCATS) and behavioral data (IVA2), using graph-based feature engineering (AOI entropy) to define high-risk computational phenotypes.

🔬 Research Interests: Human-Centered AI (HCAI), Explainable AI (XAI), AI in Education, Affective Computing, and Multimodal User Modeling.

🌱 Learning: Currently mastering Generative AI and LLM Fine-tuning (PEFT/LoRA).

💬 Ask me about: Python, Probability, DuckDB, and Data Strategy.
