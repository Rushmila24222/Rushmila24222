##Hi there, I'm Rushmila! 👋

🚀 Data Scientist (M.S. CS) | AI Researcher | Strategy & Operations

👩‍💻 About Me

I am a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in statistical modeling and a track record of driving business impact. With a background in Supply Chain Management (where I drove $3.7M+ in optimizations), I bridge the gap between complex algorithms and strategic ROI.

My technical approach is grounded in first principles. I specialize in:

ML & Math: Implementing algorithms like Hidden Markov Models and CNNs from scratch to deeply understand their mechanics.

Modern Data Engineering: Architecting scalable pipelines using DuckDB, dbt, and SQL to transform unstructured data into investment-ready insights.

Multimodal Analysis: fusing logs, audio, and vision data to solve messy, real-world problems.

🔭 I’m currently working on Economic regime detection using probabilistic models

🌱 I’m currently learning Generative AI and Large Language Model fine-tuning

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source ML projects and Data Architecture challenges
